Explosion Intensity
Given a number, return a string of the word "Boom", which varies in the following ways:
The string should include n number of "o"s, unless n is below 2 (in that case, return "boom").
If n is evenly divisible by 2, add an exclamation mark to the end.
If n is evenly divisible by 5, return the string in ALL CAPS.
If n is evenly divisible by both 2 and 5, return the string in ALL CAPS and add an exclamation mark to the end.
The example below should help clarify these instructions.

Examples
boomIntensity(4) ➞ "Boooom!"
// There are 4 "o"s and 4 is divisible by 2 (exclamation mark included)
boomIntensity(1) ➞ "boom"
// 1 is lower than 2, so we return "boom"
boomIntensity(5) ➞ "BOOOOOM"
// There are 5 "o"s and 5 is divisible by 5 (all caps)
boomIntensity(10) ➞ "BOOOOOOOOOOM!"
// There are 10 "o"s and 10 is divisible by 2 and 5 (all caps and exclamation mark included)

Notes
A number which is evenly divisible by 2 and 5 will have both effects applied (see example #4).
"Boom" will always start with a capital "B", except when n is less than 2, then return a minature explosion as "boom".

    return result + "!";
  } else if (n % 5 === 0) {
